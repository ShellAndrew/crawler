Algorithm

initialize crawler: O(1)

initialize starting seed & id: O(1)

crawler is a class that creates a dictionary that stores the pages
crawler dictionary maps the page to the other pages that it links to
node is the elements stored in the dictionary

crawler will repeatedly go through the wikipedia pages in a BFS style algorithm

using memoization to efficiently add new elements the dictionary
    -else if element is already in the dictionary just append to the list that the node mapsd to

dictionary outline:
dict = {
    Key1 {type:Node} : [Key2 {type:Node}, Key3 {type:Node}]
    Key2 {type:Node} : [Key1 {type:Node}, Key3 {type:Node}]
    Key3 {type:Node} : [Key1 {type:Node}, Key2 {type:Node}]
    ....
    etc

}

outcomes:
pagerank of all wikipedia articles related to Queen Maud Land
