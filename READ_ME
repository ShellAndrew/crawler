initialize crawler: O(1)

initialize starting seed & id: O(1)

crawler is a class that creates a dictionary that stores the pages
crawler dictionary maps the page to the other pages that it links to
node is the elements stored in the dictionary

crawler will repeatedly go through the wikipedia pages in a BFS style algorithm

using memoization to efficiently add new elements the dictionary
    -else if element is already in the dictionary just append to the list that the node mapsd to

dictionary outline:
dict = {
    Key1 {type:Node} : [Key2 {type:Node}, Key3 {type:Node}]
    Key2 {type:Node} : [Key1 {type:Node}, Key3 {type:Node}]
    Key3 {type:Node} : [Key1 {type:Node}, Key2 {type:Node}]
    ....
    etc

}

outcomes:
pagerank of all wikipedia articles related to Queen Maud Land

Current Results:
    Estimated Highest Ranking Webpage is Antarctic Treaty System
    Converged after 4 iterations of algorithm on numerous trials
    Likely due to highest number of outlinks - 500

In Progress:
    Verify Results
    Formalize Algorithm Design & Runtime
    Proof of Computation for Any Webpage
